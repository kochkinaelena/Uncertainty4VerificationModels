# Uncertainty4VerificationModels

*Documentation and more analysis code will be added*

This folder contains 2 sub-folders: `PHEME` and `Twitter 15/16`. The directory structure and the code in both directories is analogous, except for some difference in preprocessing as the datasets come in different formats.  Thus, `Twitter 15/16` directory includes code to download tweets using their ids in `download_tweets`. For both datasets `model` directories for both datasets contain the code to preprocess the data in `preprocessing`, which should be run first and it will generate `saved_data` folders that will be used as input to the models. The `models.py` file contains model definition. The `keras_lstm_outer.py` is the outer most file that pulls in functions from other files in the folder to allow to run hyper-parameter optimisation using `parameter_search.py` and `objective_functions.py`. After parametes are selected `keras_lstm_outer.py` will call evaluation function from `evaluation_functions.py` that will generate output. The produced output will be used for analysis. Code to perform analysis of runs, such as supervised and unsupervised rejection is stored in `analysis` folder.
